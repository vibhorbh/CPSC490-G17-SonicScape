# Harness log — every rule earns its place

One row per rule in our harness (CI check, `CLAUDE.md` line, issue-template
field, review habit), naming **the failure that caused it**. The rule is the
ratchet: once something goes wrong, we make it impossible to go wrong the
same way again.

A rule with no failure behind it is superstition — delete it. A failure with
no rule behind it will happen again — add one.

Bring this file to the sprint review. It is the cleanest evidence that the
team learned something, not just shipped something.

| Date | What went wrong (the failure) | Rule added | Where it lives | Added by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-15 | *(example)* A design document cited issue `#42`, which never existed — the number was invented and nobody noticed for two days | Cited issue numbers are verified against the real issue list | CI gate G3 (`.github/scripts/check_repo.py`) | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** four of the ten gates (G7-G10) were explained only in `FOR_INSTRUCTORS.md`, which students do not read - so a student could hit a red G8 or G10 with no description of what it catches or how to fix it | Every gate is documented for students in `hitl-gates.md`, in the same what-it-checks / what-it-catches / how-to-fix shape | `docs/aidlc/hitl-gates.md` | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** run against the real repository, the sprint report announced "3 issue(s) carry no `sp:` label" - and all three were the feature, task and sub-task beneath a pointed objective, which is precisely what the rule requires. A report that scolds a team for following the rule is a report the team stops reading | The unpointed warning applies to user stories only, and says outright that features, tasks and sub-tasks are *meant* to be unpointed. The open-work column is labelled "Open/carried", since work is only carried once the sprint has ended without it | `scripts/sprint_report.py` | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** the sprint and the size were each recorded twice - on the issue (milestone, `sp:` label) and again as a Projects board field - and the two copies drifted apart inside one sprint. The field table even said points go in the board field *or* the label, so a team choosing the board was silently counted as unpointed by the report | Every fact lives in exactly one place: sprint = milestone, size = `sp:` label, position = the board's Status. The board carries no custom fields | `scripts/bootstrap.sh`, setup guide section 4 | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** two labels estimated the same thing - `loe: S/M/L` and `sp: 1..8` - so an issue could carry `loe: S` next to `sp: 8` and both be "right" | One size scale, the one that sums: `sp:` points. `sp: 8` carries the old "too big, split it" meaning | labels in `scripts/bootstrap.sh` | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** the example repository pointed a story (`sp: 2`) *and* its task (`sp: 1`), so the sprint read as 3 points of capacity for a 2-point commitment - the exact error that makes every later velocity figure wrong | Points go on the objective only; children of a pointed item are rolled up into it and the labelling mistake is named | `scripts/sprint_report.py`, setup guide section 4 | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** task #5 in the example repository had no parent at all - no sub-issue link, no `## Epic` reference - so a reader could not walk from the goal down to it, and nothing detected the break | Every non-epic issue names a parent; the chain epic -> story -> feature/enhancement/bug -> task/sub-task is checked, advisory on develop and blocking into main | CI gate G10 (`.github/scripts/check_repo.py`) | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** branch protection required the check `Repository harness (G1-G6)` with a hyphen while the workflow reported `Repository harness (G1–G6)` with an en-dash - different strings, so the required check never arrived and a first pull request into `main` would have waited on it forever. The range was stale anyway (nine gates by then) | The harness check is named `Repository harness`, with no gate range to go stale and no dash to mistype; the name is asserted in one place and required in protection verbatim | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `scripts/bootstrap.sh` | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** every objective in the scaffold was written as "As a &lt;who&gt;, I want &lt;what&gt;" - which contradicts the proposal template's own instruction quoted three lines above it ("specific, measurable statements ... using action words like use case names") and matched none of the twenty proposals submitted the previous year | An objective is titled as an objective: action word plus what gets completed, in the words proposal section 2 uses. The user-story sentence is optional and lives in the issue body | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/user-story.md`, `proposal/proposal.md`, setup guide section 4 | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** G3 failed in CI on `#12`/`#42`/`#123` cited inside the course reference docs that *explain* issue numbers — the gate was scoped too widely | Content gates (G3, G6) only inspect team deliverables (`proposal/`, `docs/specs/`, `docs/design/`, `docs/sprint-reviews/`) | `is_deliverable()` in the harness | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** G9 (and G2, G7) built their own file lists instead of using `is_deliverable()`, so a team that kept the shipped worked examples while filling in proposal section 4 got two failures for documents they did not write | One definition of "your work": G2, G7 and G9 all use `is_deliverable()` | `.github/scripts/check_repo.py` | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** a student copying the scaffold and pushing got a RED harness on their very first push - the worked examples cite issues #1-#5, which exist in the example repository and not in theirs | `example-*` documents are reference material, not deliverables, so the content gates skip them; the proposal skeleton uses placeholders; G8 recognises an unfilled skeleton section and says so once | `is_deliverable()`, `proposal/proposal.md`, `gate_activities_linked()` | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** the PR-discipline gate had never once executed (it only runs on pull requests, and every earlier change was a direct push). Its first real run FAILED a fully compliant PR body, because the AI-use pattern did not accept the `## AI use` heading the PR template itself uses | Accept the section in any form (`## AI use`, `**AI use**`, `- AI usage:`), and verify a gate against a real payload before trusting it | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** copying a scaffold with `cp -r src/. dest` carried `src/.git` along, so a setup script run in the copy operated on the SOURCE repository and re-created a branch that had been deliberately deleted | Extract a scaffold with `git archive`, never `cp -r`, and check `git remote -v` before running anything that writes | session practice (and QUICKSTART's download-the-ZIP instruction avoids it) | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** the setup script's create paths had never been executed - only its skip paths - and a full run on a fresh private repo showed branch protection failing outright (GitHub forbids it on private repos on the free plan), which would have left every team's merge rule unenforced on day one | Test setup automation on a throwaway repo before handing it out; document the visibility/plan decision in QUICKSTART and git-workflow, and make the script say plainly that protection did not apply | `scripts/bootstrap.sh`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `docs/git-workflow.md` | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** CI reported "Prototype build & tests: success" while never running the tests — the glob `ls tests test_*.py **/test_*.py` failed because one pattern did not match, so the step silently skipped to the warning branch | Ask the tool, never a glob: run pytest and treat exit code 5 (no tests collected) as the only "nothing to run" case; check `package.json` scripts with node. **A gate that silently passes is worse than no gate.** | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** re-running the setup script replaced the board's Status options, which assigns new option ids and silently cleared the Status of every card on the board | `bootstrap.sh` compares the existing Status options first and only replaces them when they differ; if it must replace them it warns that cards need re-setting | `scripts/bootstrap.sh` | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** G5 flagged a fake password in a prototype test as a committed credential | Secret scan honours an explicit `# pragma: allowlist secret` marker; every exemption is greppable for review | `gate_secrets()` in the harness | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | **Real:** G4 reported a dead link that was a documented *example* inside a fenced code block | The link gate strips fenced code before scanning | `FENCE_RE` in the harness | course scaffold |
| 2026-09-15 | *(example)* A spec was written that no story asked for, and it scored nothing at the sprint review | Every spec/design doc must name its epic and stories in its first lines | CI gate G2 | course scaffold |

## How to add a row

1. Something breaks, or review catches something that *almost* broke.
2. Ask: **what check would have caught this in under a minute?**
3. Prefer a deterministic check (CI, template field, type) over a prompt
   instruction — prompts are advisory, gates are enforced.
4. Add the check, add the row, and say in your PR which row it implements.

## Rules we considered and rejected

Keep this too — knowing what you decided *not* to gate is part of the
design, and it stops the harness from growing into something nobody runs.

| Rule considered | Why we rejected it |
|---|---|
| *(example)* Fail CI on any leftover `TODO` | Too noisy this early; kept it as a warning (G6) that reviewers read instead |
